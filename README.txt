This game runs well in chrome or firefox browser.
Just clone my repo and open index.html which is located in root directory Ping-Pong-game-using-p5.js in any javascript editor to play!
This game is touch supported and can be played with two joysticks (xbox type gamepads are preferred)
To play using keyboard player1 can use W and S keys, player2 can use NUM8 and NUM2 keys and ENTER to start the game.
Enjoy! Happy js..
